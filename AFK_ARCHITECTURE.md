# AFK Architecture: AgenFK Framework

## System Overview
AgenFK follows a **Single Owner Architecture** where a centralized API server manages the framework state, ensuring consistency across CLI, UI, and MCP clients.

## Project Structure (Monorepo)
The project is organized as a TypeScript monorepo using npm workspaces under the `agentic-framework/` directory.

- `agentic-framework/packages/core`: The foundation of the system. Contains all shared types, interfaces, and core logic for item lifecycle and state management.
- `agentic-framework/packages/cli`: A command-line interface that allows developers and agents to interact with the framework (create items, update status, etc.).
- `agentic-framework/packages/server`: The central API server built with Express. It manages the `db.json` storage and broadcasts updates via WebSockets.
- `agentic-framework/packages/storage-json`: A storage plugin implementing atomic, file-based JSON persistence.
- `agentic-framework/packages/ui`: A modern web-based Kanban board built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query.

## Key Component Interactions
1.  **Server as Source of Truth**: All state changes must go through the Server.
2.  **CLI/UI as Clients**: The CLI and Web UI communicate with the Server via a RESTful API.
3.  **Real-time Updates**: The Server uses WebSockets to push state changes to the UI for immediate visual feedback.
4.  **Verification Loop**: The `verify_changes` tool (typically called via MCP or CLI) triggers the server to run external verification commands and update item status based on the result.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strong typing across the stack)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- **Storage**: JSON (local/portable)
- **Communication**: REST API, WebSockets, MCP
