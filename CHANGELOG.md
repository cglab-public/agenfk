# Changelog

All notable changes to AgEnFK are documented here.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Custom Workflow Flows**: Projects can define custom multi-step flows with named steps and exit criteria (replaces fixed TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE).
- **Flow Designer**: Visual drag-and-drop flow editor in the Kanban UI.
- **TDD Flow**: Built-in TDD flow template (TODO → CREATE_UNIT_TESTS → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → DONE).
- **`get_flow` MCP tool**: Returns the active flow for a project including all steps and exit criteria.
- **`validate_progress` evidence param**: Mandatory `evidence` field logged as a tagged comment for audit trail.
- **Flow publish/install**: Share and install community workflow flows via a public registry repo.
- **Color-coded flow steps**: Steps and Kanban columns render with configurable accent colors.
- **Step colors in FlowStep type**: `color` field added to `FlowStep` in core and UI packages.

### Changed
- `review_changes` and `test_changes` MCP tools are now aliases of `validate_progress` (kept for backward compatibility).
- `validate_progress` on the final step enforces the project's `verifyCommand` automatically.
- Workflow gatekeeper now surfaces current step's exit criteria in the authorization response.

### Platforms
- Claude Code: fully supported via PreToolUse hooks.
- Opencode: fully supported via MCP + skill system.
- Google Gemini CLI: fully supported via MCP + workflow rules.
- OpenAI Codex CLI: fully supported via MCP + `AGENTS.md` rules.
- Cursor: experimental via `.mdc` instructional rules.

- Telemetry package (`packages/telemetry`) for token usage tracking.
- `agenfk integration list/install/uninstall` commands for per-platform integration management.
- `agenfk health` command for system diagnostics.
- `agenfk upgrade --beta` flag for opting into pre-release versions.
- Parent–child status propagation: parent EPICs and STORYs auto-advance when all children advance.
- Sibling propagation: siblings on the same branch skip redundant build runs.

### Changed
- `agenfk up` now bootstraps services on first run if build artifacts are missing.
- MCP server now runs in stdio mode (`agenfk mcp`), compatible with all MCP clients.
